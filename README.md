# Predicting-Customer-Churn

Customer attrition is a big issue in any industry. Not surprisingly, one of the major focus of a data scientist is to reduce customer attrition and increase customer retention. It is relatively easier to predict and detect in the industries where monthly billing service exists Eg: telecom, internet, streaming service etc. From an organizational perspective, it is always cheaper to retain existing customers than to acquire new customers.

My goal is to build a model to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on given a dataset in this project.


This data set consists of 100 variables and approx 100 thousand records. It contains different variables explaining the telecom industry's attributes and various factors considered important while dealing with customers of the telecom industry. The target variable here is churn, which explains whether the customer will churn or not. We can use this data set to predict the customers who would churn or who wouldn't churn, depending on various variables available.
